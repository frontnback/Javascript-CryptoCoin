Made a quick CryptoCoin using JavaScript (Called it "dScriptCoin" ...sounds catchy right?) to prove how easy it is to make a blockchain.

This program does however lack proof of work, peer-2-peer transactions and does not verify sufficient funds... however it does demonstrate the simplicity of blockchain and a working project.
